What is this all about ?

After some serious problems ( 2 disc prolapses ) and complication at my back surgery one day later I had another emergency surgery and I was unable to walk or feel in my legs until 5 th day later a little feeling came back into my feet and luckyly it got better. One months I had to stay in hospital. Then I had almost 1,5 years rehabilitation . So then I took part at re - training as a company technican.

It was a senior center with around 100 residents and 80 employees, and I was Head of Building Technology & security representative for medical products.

I was working 12 hours a da , six days a week, I didnt see my wife or little 3 three years old daughter Mira not very often.

I had to stay some weeks in hospital because of heavy depression with symtomes of Burn out

We had a very difficult time and my wife took my daughter and left me.

I had to go on with life and started to work again but nothing was like ever before .

After 5 years working at the senior centre I suddenly became my 3rd disc prolapse and my doctors said I had to finish my job immediately effective.

I had a lot of pain, struggeld around with pain pills and started drinking alcohol after 6 years of abstinence. So everything went totaly wrong and I had to go to rehab.

A few months later I was recovered again but now I had to face another problem :

I was homeless and without work this was a long time of 1,5 years.

With the help of friends I managed it to get unemployment benefit and a became a roomer in friends house, and I can use the garden house too.

I started to educate myself nights and days about social media and blockchain technoligy, and cryptocurrencies.

In all this time I always had the vision of building Comnity a dapp and creating Comnity Coin Token and start a new virtual game ecosystem.
